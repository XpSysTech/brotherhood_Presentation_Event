# Boena Investment Fund — Information Session Page

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a **single-page informational website** created for a **one-day, in-person investment information session** hosted by the Boena Investment Fund.

The page was intentionally designed as a **temporary, event-specific site** to provide clarity, structure, and professionalism for attendees before and during the session. It is not intended to function as a permanent public website.

The visual and structural style is inspired by **large government, institutional, and private-sector forums and conferences**, prioritizing clarity, hierarchy, and restrained presentation over branding or marketing.
